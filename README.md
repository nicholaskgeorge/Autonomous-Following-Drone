# Autonomous-Following-Drone
This project involves creating a drone which is capable of tracking the movements of a persons face and body and follow them where they go. In addition the drone will be able to avoid incoming objects and stay level. The drone is completely autonomous using a raspberry-pi 4, camera and a flight controller which the raspberry-pi commands.
